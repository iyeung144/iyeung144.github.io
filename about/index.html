<p>Welcome to my Github Pages. Since I completed my postgraduate program of Risk Management Science in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, I started spending time on studying quantitative financial risk management and coding in R and Python. Besides, I am interested in banking and finance law, which is directly related to my job.
