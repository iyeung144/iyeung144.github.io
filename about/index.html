<p>Welcome to my Github Pages. I am a risk management practitioner in Hong Kong financial insudtry. My focus is on operational risk, market risk and investment compliance. I enjoy coding to help understanding the meaning behind figures and data. Besides, I am interested in banking and finance law, which is directly related to my job area of focus.
